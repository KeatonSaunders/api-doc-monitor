(Note that the symbol has to have the feature enabled to be used.) UPDATE 2025-04-21: The exact date \"Order Amend Keep Priority\" will be enabled has not yet been determined. New field amendAllowed becomes visible in Exchange Information responses.

UPDATE 2025-04-21: The exact date DECREMENT STP will be enabled has not yet been determined. Instead of expiring only the maker, only the taker, or unconditionally both orders, STP decrement decreases the available quantity of both orders and increases the prevented quantity of both orders by the amount of the prevented match. This expires the order with less available quantity as ( filled quantity + prevented quantity ) equals order quantity . Both orders expire if their available quantities are equal. It is called a \"decrement\" because it reduces available quantity. Behavior when querying and/or canceling with orderId and origClientOrderId/cancelOrigClientOrderId : The behavior when both parameters were provided was not consistent across all endpoints. Moving forward, when both parameters are provided, the order is first searched for using its orderId , and if found, origClientOrderId / cancelOrigClientOrderId is checked against that order. If both conditions pass, the request succeeds. If both conditions are not met the request is rejected. Affected requests: REST API: GET /api/v3/order DELETE /api/v3/order POST /api/v3/order/cancelReplace WebSocket API: order.status order.cancel order.cancelReplace FIX API OrderCancelRequest <F> OrderCancelRequestAndNewOrderSingle <XCN> Behavior when canceling with listOrderId and listClientOrderId : The behavior when both parameters were provided was not consistent across all endpoints. Moving forward, when both parameters are passed, the order list is first searched for using its listOrderId , and if found, listClientOrderId is checked against that order list. If both conditions are not met the request is rejected. Affected requests: REST API DELETE /api/v3/orderList WebSocket API orderList.cancel SBE: A new schema 3:0 ( spot_3_0.xml ) is now available. The current schema 2:1 ( spot_2_1.xml ) is now deprecated and will be retired in 6 months as per our schema deprecation policy. Note that trying to use schema 3:0 before it is released will result in an error. Changes in schema 3:0: Support for Order Amend Keep Priority: Added field amendAllowed to ExchangeInfoResponse. New Messages OrderAmendmentsResponse and OrderAmendKeepPriorityResponse All enums now have a NON_REPRESENTABLE variant. This will be used to encode new enum values in the future, which would be incompatible with 3:0. New enum variant DECREMENT for selfTradePreventionMode and allowedSelfTradePreventionModes symbolStatus enum values AUCTION_MATCH , PRE_TRADING and POST_TRADING have been removed. Fields usedSor , orderCapacity , workingFloor , preventedQuantity , and matchType are no longer optional. Field orderCreationTime in ExecutionReportEvent is now optional. When using deprecated schema 2:1 on the WebSocket API to listen to the User Data Stream: ListStatusEvent field listStatusType will be rendered as ExecStarted when it should have been Updated . Upgrade to schema 3:0 to get the correct value. ExecutionReportEvent field selfTradePreventionMode will be rendered as None when it should have been Decrement . This only happens when executionType is TradePrevention . ExecutionReportEvent field orderCreationTime will be rendered as -1 when it has no value. All schemas below 3:0 are unable to represent responses for Order Amend Keep Priority requests and any response that could contain the STP mode DECREMENT (e.g. Exchange Information, order placement, order cancelation, or querying the status of your order). When a response cannot be represented in the requested schema, an error is returned.\nOrder Amend Keep Priority becomes available. (Note that the symbol has to have the feature enabled to be used.)

Previously, this returned true if you were subscribed to the user data stream of your logged-on account. Now returns true if you have at least one active user data stream subscription, otherwise false . userDataStream.unsubscribe supports closing multiple subscriptions. When called with no parameter, this will close all subscriptions. When called with subscriptionId , this will attempt to close the subscription matching that Id, if it exists. The authorization for this request has been changed to NONE . Field subscriptionId has been added to the User Data Stream events payload when listening through the WebSocket API .

WebSocket API and REST API are functionally equivalent: they provide the same features, accept the same parameters, return the same status and error codes.\nWebsocket API will be available on 2025-02-25 and can be accessed through this URL: wss://ws-dapi.binance.com/ws-dapi/v1\nwss://ws-dapi.binance.com/ws-dapi/v1\nWebSocket API allows placing orders, canceling orders, etc. through a WebSocket connection.\nWebSocket API is a separate service from WebSocket Market Data streams.
